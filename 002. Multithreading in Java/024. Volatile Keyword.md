To understand the "Volatile" keyword in Java, let's first take an example.

Suppose, we have a class "SharedObject" like this - 

    class SharedObject {
        private boolean flag = false;

        public void setFlagTrue() {
            this.flag = true;
        }
        public void printIfFlagTrue() {
            while(!flag){
                // Do Nothing
            }
            System.out.println("Flag is true!");
        }
    }

Here, we have a variable "flag" which is a boolean variable, initially set to "false".

We have two methods. The "setFlagTrue" method will set the flag to "true", whereas the "printIfFlagTrue" method will print something if the flag is true. If the flag is false, the infinite while loop will run.

Now, let's create two threads. One will be a "Writer" thread so it will call the "setFlagTrue" method, and the other will be a "Reader" thread so it will call the "printIfFlagTrue" method.

    SharedObject sharedObject = new SharedObject();

    Thread writerThread = new Thread(() -> {
        sharedObject.setFlagTrue();
    });

    Thread readerThread = new Thread(() -> {
        sharedObject.printIfFlagTrue();
    });

Now, we want that the "readerThread" will run first so that we see an infinite while loop for some time and only after some time, the "writer" thread will update the flag to "true". That's simple, we can simply add a delay to the "writerThread" so the CPU scheduler will then pick the "readerThread" first.

    Thread writerThread = new Thread(() -> {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        sharedObject.setFlagTrue();
    });

So, with this code, what should we expect?

Well, it looks like initially, the readerThread will execute and for 1 second, we see nothing in terminal as the while loop is executing. But, then the writer thread updates the flag's value to "true" which means the "while" loop no longer is valid and hence, we should see the terminal print "Flag is true!".

But, that does not happen when we actually run the code. We just keep seeing a blank terminal that's it!

Does that mean the "flag" never became "true"? Well, to verify this, let's add a print statement inside the "setFlagTrue" method - 

    public void setFlagTrue() {
        System.out.println("Writer Thread made the thread true!");
        this.flag = true;
    }

Now, we see that the terminal will print "Writer Thread made the thread true!" after 1 second but still, the while loop kept executing. What's this odd behavior? It looks like the "Reader Thread" did not get the updated value of the "flag" variable. But how can this be possible?

# THE PROBLEM

The reason is that the "flag" variable is "cached" in the local memory of the "Reader Thread". And that's why, even if the "Writer Thread" updates the variable, the "Reader" thread will continue using the "cached" value which is "false".

When a thread accesses a variable, it may keep a local copy of that variable in its own CPU cache to improve performance by reducing access to main memory. However, this optimization can cause problems if multiple threads are sharing and modifying the same variable, as each thread’s view of the variable can become "stale" or out of sync with the actual value in main memory.

# THE SOLUTION

And that's where we can use the volatile" keyword in Java.

This keyword ensures that all reads and writes to a variable go directly to and from main memory. When a variable is marked "volatile", every read will fetch the latest value, and every write will immediately update main memory, making it visible to other threads.

So, all we need to do is update the "flag" variable like this -

    class SharedObject {
        private volatile boolean flag = false; <- USED 'volatile' keyword
        .....
    }

And now, the program runs just as we expected.

# HOW "volatile" KEYWORD WORKS?

When you declare a variable as "volatile", the JVM prevents threads from caching it locally. This forces threads to always read from and write to main memory for that variable, ensuring that any update is immediately visible to other threads.

# THE LIMITATIONS

"volatile" can only be applied to individual variables, not blocks of code. Therefore, it cannot be used to synchronize code that depends on multiple shared variables.

For example, if you have a set of variables that must be read or written together as a unit, volatile does not provide a way to enforce this. synchronized or locks like "ReentrantLock" are necessary in such cases.

Declaring an object reference as "volatile" only ensures visibility for that reference, not for the contents of the object it points to. For example, if you have a "volatile List<Integer> myList", changes to "myList" (like setting it to a new list) are visible to all threads. However, modifications to the list’s contents (like adding elements) are not guaranteed to be visible.

"volatile" guarantees visibility, but not "atomicity". "Atomicity" means that compound actions (like incrementing a value, checking a condition and setting a variable, etc.) occur as a single, indivisible step.

For instance, if you have a "volatile int counter", incrementing it with "counter++" involves reading, incrementing, and writing the value back. Since "counter++" is not an atomic operation, other threads could see intermediate states, leading to race conditions.

"volatile" can introduce performance overhead when used on highly contested variables, as each read or write must go directly to main memory. This can create significant contention, particularly in performance-sensitive applications.

So, the bottom line is -

    Use volatile when you only need visibility (e.g., flags that are checked and updated independently).
