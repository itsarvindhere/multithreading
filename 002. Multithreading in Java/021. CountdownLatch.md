"CountDownLatch" is a "synchronization" aid in Java that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed by the other threads completes.

Let's say we want to block the "main" thread until all other threads have completed specific tasks. In such scenario, we can use "CountDownLatch".

Let's understand this with an example.

# WITHOUT COUNTDOWNLATCH

Let's first see what is the problem if we use the Executors Framework only to achieve it.

Suppose, in our code, we have a class like this - 

    class DependentService implements Callable<String> {

        @Override
        public String call() throws Exception {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " service started!");

            Thread.sleep(2000);

            return "ok";
        }
    }

So, it is simply extending a "Callable" and hence implementing "call" method. In this method, all we do is print something and then wait for 2 seconds and then return "ok".

Now, let's have three different threads and let's pass this "Callable" to those three threads.

    ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

    Future<String> future1 = executorService.submit(new DependentService());
    
    Future<String> future2 = executorService.submit(new DependentService());
    
    Future<String> future3 = executorService.submit(new DependentService());

Now, we want that the main thread does not run until all these three threads have finished executing. We know that we can do that using "future.get()" method because it blocks the main thread.

    future1.get();
    future2.get();
    future3.get();

    System.out.println("All dependent services finished. Starting main method...");

    executorService.shutdown();

And this will do what we want to achieve. Until all three threads are not complete, the main thread won't run.

But, now imagine if we have like a 100 different tasks to submit. Does that mean we will keep on calling "get" method on all those? One way would be to call "invokeAll" which takes a list of "Callable" as input and returns us a list of "Future". So, we can loop over that list and call "get" on each "Future" but there is an even better and simpler way and that's using "CountDownLatch".

Each call to Future.get() waits only for its specific task to complete, so itâ€™s useful when you have independent tasks that return a value. However, if you have multiple tasks, you would need to call get() on each Future, which can become complex in scenarios where synchronization across multiple tasks is needed.

# WITH COUNTDOWNLATCH

Let's now see how does "CountDownLatch" helps in this case.

We initialize the "CountDownLatch" class by calling its constructor that takes an argument "count". This "count" is simply the number of times "countDown()" must be called before the threads can proceed. Each time "countDown()" is called, the "count"
reduces by 1. And when it becoems 0, any threads that were waiting on the "latch" using the "await()" method are released and can continue their execution.

So, let's first create a new "CountDownLatch" instance - 

    int numberOfServices = 3;
    
    ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfServices);

    CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfServices);

Now, let's change the class a bit so that it accepts the "CountDownLatch" in its constructor so that we can call the "countDown()" method of the latch inside "call" method -

    class DependentService implements Callable<String> {

        private final CountDownLatch latch;

        public DependentService(CountDownLatch latch) {
            this.latch = latch;
        }

        @Override
        public String call() throws Exception {
            try {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " service started!");
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } finally {
                latch.countDown();
            }
            return "ok";
        }
    }

It is a good idea to call "countDown()" inside the "finally" block so that even if there is an exception, it is always called.

And now, we can update our code like this -

    CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfServices);

    executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));
    executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));
    executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));

    latch.await();

    System.out.println("All dependent services finished. Starting main method...");

    executorService.shutdown();

And that's it!

We have three threads and each will execute the "call" method. And since the "CountDownLatch" is initialized with a count of 3, it means till the count is not 0, the main method will remain blocked. And the count reduces only when "countDown()" is called. And since each thread will execute "call" method which in turn executes the "countDown()" method, it means only when all three threads finish executing, the main thread will execute.

It is usually helpful when we do not care about the returned result of the executing of each task in each thread. We just want the task to execute that's it.

If you want the returned value as well, then you have to use "future.get()".

# USING COUNTDOWNLATCH WITHOUT EXECUTORSERVICE

It is also worth mentioning that you can use "CountDownLatch" even if you are manually creating Threads. It is not necessary to have "ExecutorService" to use "CountDownLatch".

So, let's change the "DependentService" class a bit since we know the "Thread" constructor takes a "Runnable", not a "Callable".

    class DependentService implements Runnable {

        private final CountDownLatch latch;

        public DependentService(CountDownLatch latch) {
            this.latch = latch;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " service started!");
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            } finally {
                latch.countDown();
            }
        }
    }

Now, the main method can be updated like this -

    int numberOfServices = 3;

    CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfServices);

    for(int i = 0; i < numberOfServices; i++) {
        new Thread(new DependentService(latch)).start();
    }

    latch.await();

    System.out.println("All dependent services finished. Starting main method...");

So, we can use the "CountDownLatch" even when we manually create Threads.

# PASSING A TIMEOUT TO "await()"

We can also specify how much time a thread should wait before other threads execute. If in that time all threads do not execute, then the main method will execute and it won't wait for those other threads to execute. 

For example, if we had - 

    latch.await(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

And the "run" method was like this - 

    Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(6000);
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " service started!");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        } finally {
            latch.countDown();
        }
    }

Here, we see the "run" method will wait for 6 seconds before it does something. But since the timeout is "5" seconds in "await()", it means before any thread executes the "run" method, the main thread starts its execution already. The other threads will continue executing in background.

And that's why, the terminal will print - 

    All dependent services finished. Starting main method...
    Thread-2 service started!
    Thread-0 service started!
    Thread-1 service started!

# COUNTDOWNLATCH IS NOT REUSABLE

Once the count reaches 0, you cannot reuse the CountDownlatch.

It is designed to be a one-time-use synchronization mechanism. When the count reaches zero, all waiting threads are released, and the latch cannot be reset or reused. You would need to create a new CountDownLatch instance if you need to use a countdown again.
