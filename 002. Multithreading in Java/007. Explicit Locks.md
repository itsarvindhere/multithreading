With intrinsic locks (synchronized), a thread must wait indefinitely to acquire the lock if another thread holds it. There’s no built-in mechanism to try acquiring the lock without blocking.

With the "synchronized" keyword, deadlocks can occur if multiple threads are waiting on each other’s locks, and there is no way to set a timeout to prevent this.

In certain scenarios, a thread may need to acquire the same lock multiple times (e.g., calling methods that also require the same lock). With intrinsic locks, this is handled automatically but with limitations on flexibility.

With intrinsic locks (synchronized), there’s no control over which thread gets the lock next. By default, it’s not guaranteed that the longest-waiting thread will acquire the lock, which can lead to thread starvation.

In certain situations, multiple threads can safely read a resource simultaneously, but write operations need exclusive access. With synchronized, you don’t have the ability to differentiate between reading and writing threads, leading to reduced concurrency for read-heavy workloads.

And these are all the issues that we have when using "synchronized" keyword or "Intrinsic" locks in Java. The solution is to use "Explicit Locks".

To create an "Explicit Lock", we use the "Lock" interface that we get from "java.util.concurrent.locks" package.

We can create an implementation class of the "Lock" interface and we can do that using Anonymous Class as well. Something like this - 

    Lock lock = new Lock() {...}

Now, this interface has some methods that we have to implement. 

Let's talk about some of those methods first.

## void lock()

This method is called to acquire a lock. So, whatever Thread calls the "lock" method, then it means the "Thread" is trying to acquire a lock on some resource. If the lock is already held by another thread, the current thread will wait until the lock becomes available.

## void unlock()

This method releases the lock. You must always call this after a successful "lock()" or "tryLock()" to avoid deadlock.

## boolean tryLock() 

This method attempts to acquire the lock without waiting. It returns "true" if the lock was acquired and "false" if it wasn't.

##  boolean tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)

This method tries to acquire the lock but waits for the specified time if the lock is not immediately available. If the lock is not acquired within the timeout period, it returns "false".

# BUILT-IN IMPLEMENTATIONS OF LOCK INTERFACE

Now, it is not always necessary to create our own Implementation Class as there are some built-in classes that implement Lock interface that we can use.

## ReentrantLock

This is the most commonly used implementation of the Lock interface. 

It allows threads to acquire the lock multiple times (hence "reentrant"). 

When a thread holds the lock, it can re-enter and acquire it again without blocking. 

## ReentrantReadWriteLock

This class implements the Lock interface and provides a pair of locks (read and write). Multiple threads can hold the read lock simultaneously as long as no threads hold the write lock. 

When a thread wants to write, it must acquire the write lock, which ensures exclusive access. This is useful for scenarios where reads are frequent and writes are infrequent, improving performance.


# USING A REENTRANT LOCK

So, let's use a "REENTRANT" Lock instead of "synchronized" keyword. What we want is that if a Thread is taking a long time to execute the "withdraw" function, we do not want the "Thread 2" to keep waiting. It should only wait for specific time and if in that time it does not get the lock, then it stops waiting.

So, we can create a new variable in BankAccount class which will be a private and final variable of type "Lock" - 

    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

Now, we can tweak our "withdraw" method. We won't use "synchronized" anymore.

    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " attempting to withdraw $" + amount);

        try {
            if (lock.tryLock(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
                if(balance >= amount) {
                    try {
                        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " proceeding with withdrawal");
                        Thread.sleep(3000); // SIMULATING A DATABASE CHANGE
                        balance -= amount;
                        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " completed withdrawal. Remaining balance is $"+ balance);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        throw new RuntimeException(e);
                    } finally {
                        lock.unlock();
                    }
                } else {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " insufficient balance");
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " could not acquire the lock. Please try again later...");
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

So, let's break this down.

    if (lock.tryLock(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {...}
    else {...}

First, we have the outer "try catch" block. Here, we are calling the "tryLock" method and passing the time as "1000 milliseconds". This means, a Thread will try if it can acquire the lock in 1 second. If it does, then this "tryLock" method will return "true". Otherwise, we move to the else block which simple prints that this Thread could not acquire the lock.

    if(balance >= amount) {...}
    else {...}

Inside the if block, we check if the amount to withdraw is less than or equal to balance. Only if it is true, we can withdraw. Otherwise, we will simply print that the balance is insufficient.

        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " proceeding with withdrawal");
            Thread.sleep(3000); // SIMULATING A DATABASE CHANGE
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " completed withdrawal. Remaining balance is $"+ balance);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }

Now, in this inner if block, have another try catch. This one is beacuse we also have "Thread.sleep" method here which may throw the "Interrupted Exception". Yes, we have a catch block outside too but there is one more reason to have an inner try catch.

Note that we have a "finally" block.

    finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }

In this "finally" block, we are calling the "unlock" method. Just think of this for a moment. If a Thread reaches this piece of code, it means it has acquired a lock right? And if it has acquired a lock, then when it is done, it should also release that lock. And that's why, we have this "finally" block where we are releasing this lock by calling the "unlock" method.

Always make sure to surround the resource that is supposed to be protected with the lock inside a try catch and finally block and then make sure to release the lock in the "finally" block.

One more thing that we should do is to invoke the "interrupt" method for current thread in the "catch" block.

    catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }

Usually, we just print the exception to the terminal which is not a good practice.

Swallowing an exception usually means catching it and not doing anything with it, which can hide problems in your code.

When you catch the "InterruptedException" and swallow it, you essentially prevent any higher-level methods/thread groups from noticing the interrupt which may cause problems.

By calling "Thread.currentThread().interrupt()", you set the interrupt flag of the thread, so higher-level interrupt handlers will notice it and can handle it appropriately.

# WHAT IS THE MEANING OF "REENTRANT"?

Let's take an example of a class with two methods "outer" and "inner".

    public void outerMethod() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println("Outer Method");
            innerMethod();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void innerMethod() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println("Inner Method");
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReenterantExample example = new ReenterantExample();
        example.outerMethod();
    }

So here, we just have one "main" thread. All it does is first call the "outerMethod", and then acquires a lock. Then, it prints "Outer Method" to the terminal and then calls "innerMethod".

Now something interesting happens. The "innerMethod" is also having "lock.lock()" which means the main thread will try to acquire a lock again but there is only one thread here. The main thread already has a lock on "outer" method and now, the "inner" method is also waiting to acquire a lock. For that, the "outer" method must finish. But, the "outer" method will only release the lock when the "inner" method has finished.

And this is a deadlock situation.

But, that's something which does not happen in "Reenterant" lock. A reentrant lock is one where a process can claim the lock multiple times without blocking on itself.

It's useful in situations where it's not easy to keep track of whether you've already grabbed a lock. If a lock is non re-entrant you could grab the lock, then block when you go to grab it again, effectively deadlocking your own process.

And for this reason, the above code will run without any issues.

When we use a "Reenterant" Lock, a count is maintained behind the scenes to know how many times a Thread has acquired a lock. So, when the "outerMethod" is called and the "lock.lock()" is executed, the lock is acquired once. So count = 1.

Then, when "inner" method is called, then again lock.lock() gets called so the count = 2.

Then, when "inner" finishes executing, the finally block runs and it calls "lock.unlock" which means count now becomes 1 again.

And finally, the "outer" finishes executing and so, the finally block runs and it calls "lock.unlock" which means count now became 0. And now, the lock is released by the Thread. And while the lock is not released, no other Thread can execute the "outerMethod".

# WHAT IS lockInterruptibly() method?

When we use lock.lock() method, if the lock is already held by another thread, the calling thread will block (wait) until the lock is released. Once the lock is released by the thread that currently holds it, the waiting thread will acquire the lock and proceed.

This means, if the other thread never releases its lock, then the Current Thread will wait indefinitely. And this also means that the thread will not respond to any interruptions.

There is another method that we get from the "Lock" interface named "lockInterruptibly" that allows a thread to try and acquire a lock, but if the thread is interrupted while it is waiting for the lock, it will throw an "InterruptedException" and stop waiting for the lock.

This is useful in scenarios where you want to avoid a thread waiting indefinitely in case of interruptions or other external events.


Let's say we have this code in the main method - 

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "Thread 1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "Thread 2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        // Interrupt Thread 2 after 1 second
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        t2.interrupt();

And in the BankAccount class, we have this withdraw() method -

     public void withdraw(int amount) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " attempting to withdraw $" + amount);
        try {
            lock.lockInterruptibly();{
            if(balance >= amount) {
                try {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " proceeding with withdrawal");
                    Thread.sleep(3000); // SIMULATING A DATABASE CHANGE
                    balance -= amount;
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " completed withdrawal. Remaining balance is $"+ balance);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                } finally {
                        lock.unlock();
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " insufficient balance");
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " was interrupted!");
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }

Now, when the first thread calls the method, then it gets the lock because there is no other thread that has a lock on the critical section (inside try block) yet. Now, this thread will wait for "3" seconds because we have Thread.sleep with 3 seconds.

At that point, when the second thread tries to acquire a lock, it sees that the lock is already held by another thread. So, it starts waiting. But, in our main method, after 1 second, we interrupt the Thread 2. And since we are using "lockInterruptibly" here, the second thread will stop waiting and throw an Interrupted Exception. Hence, this will be the terminal - 

    Thread 1 attempting to withdraw $50
    Thread 2 attempting to withdraw $50
    Thread 1 proceeding with withdrawal
    Thread Thread 2 was interrupted!
    Thread 1 completed withdrawal. Remaining balance is $50

    Process finished with exit code 0

If we had used lock.lock() in the above code this would have happened -

If Thread 2 tries to acquire the lock while Thread 1 holds it, Thread 2 will block and wait indefinitely until the lock becomes available.

If Thread 2 is interrupted while waiting for the lock, it will not throw an InterruptedException since the lock() method does not respond to interrupts. Instead, Thread 2 will continue to wait.

So, with lockInterruptibly(), the Thread 2 can handle the interruption and exit the waiting state, allowing it to perform other actions or terminate gracefully.
