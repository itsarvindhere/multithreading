We have already discussed 'Future' in Java which is used to handle asynchronous tasks. We can use its "get()" method to retrieve the result of that asynchronous task if we want to. Similarly, it offers a lot of other methods that we can use.

But, one of the biggest drawbacks of a "Future" is that when we call "get()" to get the result, it will block the thread that is calling that "get()" method. It means, if the task takes 10 seconds, then for 10 seconds, the code will remain blocked and anything that we have written after calling "get()" will not execute until the "Future" completes.

In Java 8, "CompletableFuture" was introduced which has "Non-Blocking" methods like "thenAccept()" and "thenApply()" which handle the result once it is available and calling them does not block the main thread.

We can create a new object of type "CompletableFuture" by usng the "supplyAsync" function of "CompletableFuture" class. This is the method signature - 

    public static <U> CompletableFuture<U> supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier) {
        return asyncSupplyStage(ASYNC_POOL, supplier);
    }

So, this method takes an argument of type "Supplier<U>". What is this "Supplier"? This is a built-in functional interface in Java - 

    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface Supplier<T> {
        T get();
    }

This means, we can pass a lamda expression to the "supplyAsync" method that will return something. So, if we write - 

    CompletableFuture<String> cf = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
            System.out.println("In the worker thread!");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
        return "ok";
    });

This means whatever is passed inside this lambda expression is what will run in a new thread. Now, by default, tasks in a "CompletableFuture" run in daemon threads when using the "CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()" or "CompletableFuture.runAsync()" methods without specifying a custom executor.

This means that if our main thread finishes executing, it will not wait for the Daemon Thread.

That's why, if we have this code in our main method - 

    CompletableFuture<String> cf = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
            System.out.println("In the worker thread!");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
        return "ok";
    });

    System.out.println("In the main thread!");

While you may think that it will first print "In the main thread!", then it will wait for 5 seconds and print "In the worker thread", that won't happen. In fact, the terminal just prints "In the main thread!" and then stops. That's because the task that we have passed using "supplyAsync" runs in a "Daemon Thread" and as we know, if the main application thread completes and only daemon threads remain, the JVM will terminate without waiting for the daemon threads to complete their tasks.

Since "CompletableFuture" simply "implements" the "Future" interface, it means we can use "get()" method on it to block the main thread if we want to -

    CompletableFuture<String> cf = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
            System.out.println("In the worker thread!");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
        return "ok";
    });

    String result = cf.get();
    System.out.println("In the main thread!");

In this case, the terminal does not print anything for 5 seconds and after 5 seconds it prints - 

    In the worker thread!
    In the main thread!

But, this doesn't actually help because if we do this, then what's the difference between "Future" and "CompletableFuture"?

# USING A CUSTOM EXECUTOR

To keep "CompletableFuture" tasks alive independently of the main thread, create a custom "ExecutorService" with non-daemon threads and pass it to "CompletableFuture". Non-daemon threads will continue executing even if the main thread completes.

If you look at the "CompletableFuture" class, then there is another "supplyAsync" method like this - 

    public static <U> CompletableFuture<U> supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier,
                                                       Executor executor) {
        return asyncSupplyStage(screenExecutor(executor), supplier);
    }

So, this one takes an "Executor" as second argument to which we can pass an "ExecutorService".

    ExecutorService executorService = Executors.Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

    CompletableFuture<String> cf = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
            System.out.println("In the worker thread!");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }

        return "ok";
    }, executorService); <- PASSING HERE

    System.out.println("In the main thread!");

Now, if we run the code, we will see - 

    In the main thread!

Then, after 5 seconds it says - 

    In the main thread!
    In the worker thread!

So here, the code will not block the main thread but once the main thread stops executing, this will also not stop the task running in the separate thread now that we are using a non-daemon thread.

But, the terminal keeps running. That's because we have to shutdown the "executorService".


    CompletableFuture<String> cf = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
            System.out.println("In the worker thread!");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }

        return "ok";
    }, executorService);

    executorService.shutdown(); <- SHUTTING DOWN

    System.out.println("In the main thread!");

# USING runAsync()

There is another method in "CompletableFuture" using which we can run some task asynchronously. It is "runAsync()". And it looks like this -

    public static CompletableFuture<Void> runAsync(Runnable runnable) {
        return asyncRunStage(ASYNC_POOL, runnable);
    }

So, this one accepts a "Runnable", instead of a "Supplier". As we know, a "Runnable" doesn't return something. So, if we have a task that simply executes without returning something, we can use "runAsync".

    CompletableFuture<?> cf = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
            System.out.println("In the worker thread!");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }, executorService);
    executorService.shutdown();

# COMBINING RESULTS

One of the features of a "CompletableFuture" is that it lets us do something with the result of a "CompletableFuture" once it completes. Let's say we pass a "Supplier" that returns "Hello". Maybe we want to append " World" to this returned string. So, we can do that using "thenApply" method.

    cf.thenApply(result -> result + " World");

Now, the "thenApply" will return a new "CompletableFuture". So, we have to assign it to some variable to use this new "CompletableFuture".

    CompletableFuture<String> cf1 = cf.thenApply(result -> result + " World");

    String result = cf1.get();
    System.out.println("Result of execution is " + result);

There is another method named "thenAccept" which also lets us do something with the result once the "CompletableFuture" completes. But, this one does not return any new "CompletableFuture". So, we can simply do something with the returned result.

    cf.thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Result of execution is " + result));

Since we are not calling "get()" here, this will not block the main thread.

Finally, we have a method named "thenRun()" which takes a "Runnable" as argument so it means we can pass something that does not take any input and does not return anything. It simply does something.

    cf.thenRun(() -> System.out.println("Completable Future Completed"));

Methods like "thenAccept" and "thenRun" are non-blocking. They donâ€™t guarantee execution order based on the order they appear in the code but rather on when their triggers are ready (i.e., when the previous stage completes).

# thenCompose

Let's say we have two asynchronous tasks. When the first task returns something, we want to take that returned result and use it inside other task. How can we do that using a "CompletableFuture"? Well, for that, we have a method named "thenCompose".

"thenCompose" is a powerful method in "CompletableFuture" for chaining dependent asynchronous tasks, where the second task depends on the result of the first. Unlike "thenApply", which transforms a result directly, thenCompose "flattens" the nested futures, making it easier to work with multiple asynchronous stages.

    thenCompose(Function<? super T, ? extends CompletionStage<U>> fn)

"thenCompose" takes a function which takes the result of first stage and returns a new "CompletionStage" (such as a "CompletableCFuture") for the next asynchronous task.

Let's take a simple example for this. Suppose that we have two asynchronous tasks. One will take some time to fetch the "User Id". Then, the other task will take that fetched user id and then fetch the user details. It means that the second task depends on the result of the first task.

And here, we can use "thenCompose".

Let's say this is the first task - 

    public static CompletableFuture<Integer> getUserId(ExecutorService executorService) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Fetching the user id...");
            // Simulating a delay
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
            return 42; // Returning some user ID
        }, executorService);
    }

And this is the second task -

    public static CompletableFuture<String> getUserDetails(int userId, ExecutorService executorService) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Fetching the user for the user ID: " + userId);
            // Simulating a delay
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
            return "User details for ID: "+ userId; // Returning some user details
        }, executorService);
    }

And so, we can use "thenCompose" here - 

    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {

        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        getUserId(executorService)
                .thenCompose(result -> getUserDetails(result, executorService))
                .thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("User details are: "+ result))
                .whenComplete((result,ex) -> executorService.shutdown());
    }

Note that here, we used "whenComplete" which takes a lamda expression as input and this is executed once the "CompletableFuture" will complete. So, in our case, we will shutdown the ExecutorService once the "CompletableFuture" completes.

And so, this is what we will get in the terminal - 

    Fetching the user id...
    Fetching the user for the user ID: 42
    User details are: User details for ID: 42


# thenCombine

We have already seen "thenCompose" which lets us take the result of one asynchrnous task and pass it to other asynchronous task in a very clean way.

What if we have two "independent" async tasks but we want the result of them in a combined manner once both complete. 

For this use case, we have a method named "thenCombine".

This is especially useful when you have two tasks that can run concurrently, and you want to perform some operation on their results after they finish.

The "thenCombine" method combines two "CompletableFutures" and produces a new "CompletableFuture" that will be completed when both of the original futures complete. The result of the new future is computed by applying a specified function to the results of the two original futures.

This is how the function is defined in the class - 

    thenCombine(CompletionStage<U> other, BiFunction<? super T,? super U,? extends V> fn)

Here "other" is the second "CompletionStage" (such as a "CompletableFuture") that we want to combine to the first one.

"fn" is a "BiFunction" that takes two arguments - The result of the first "CompletableFuture" "T" and the result of the second "CompletableFuture" "U", and then returns a combined result "V".

Let's again take an example.

Let's say we have a task that gives us the first name of the user - 

    public static CompletableFuture<String> getUserFirstName(ExecutorService executorService) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Fetching first name...");
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
            return "John";
        }, executorService);
    }

And we have another task that gives us the last name of the user -

    public static CompletableFuture<String> getUserLastName(ExecutorService executorService) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Fetching last name...");
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
            return "Doe";
        }, executorService);
    }

Now, the two are independent as one doesn't depend on the result of the other.

But, we need the combined result of the two so we can use "thenCombine" here - ]

    getUserFirstName(executorService)
                .thenCombine(getUserLastName(executorService), (firstName, lastName) -> firstName + " " + lastName)
                .thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Result is: " + result))
                .whenComplete((result,ex) -> executorService.shutdown());

So, Both tasks (getUserFirstName and getUserLastName) run concurrently, and "thenCombine" ensures they are both finished before proceeding.

thenCombine is ideal for scenarios where you need to perform an operation that depends on the results of two independent asynchronous tasks. It allows combining results in a clean, functional way without blocking, preserving the asynchronous nature of CompletableFuture.

# HANDLING MULTIPLE COMPLETABLE FUTURES

What if we have multiple Futures and we want to ensure all of them complete. Maybe we have like 5 different CompletableFutures and we want to make sure all of them complete. In that case, we can use a method named "allOf" which takes a comma separated list of futures. This method will return a new "CompletableFuture".

    CompletableFuture<Void> allFutures = CompletableFuture.allOf(future1, future2, future3);

The "allOf" method in "CompletableFuture" is used when you have multiple independent asynchronous tasks and want to wait for all of them to complete before performing a final action. This method is particularly useful when you donâ€™t need to combine the results of each task but want to ensure all tasks have finished before proceeding.

Since the newly returned "CompletableFuture" returns a CompletableFuture<Void>, it doesnâ€™t directly provide the individual results of the futures. However, you can access the results of the original futures once they complete.

Suppose we have three tasks that:

    - Fetch data from an external source.
    - Process data.
    - Generate a report.
  
This is the first task - 

    public static CompletableFuture<String> fetchData(ExecutorService executorService) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Fetching data...");
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
            return "Data";
        }, executorService);
    }

This is the second task -

    public static CompletableFuture<String> processData(ExecutorService executorService) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Processing data...");
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
            return "Processed Data";
        }, executorService);
    }

And finally, this is the third task -

    public static CompletableFuture<String> generateReport(ExecutorService executorService) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Generating report...");
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
            return "Report";
        }, executorService);
    }

So, we can use the "allOf" method as -

    CompletableFuture
                .allOf(fetchData(executorService), processData(executorService), generateReport(executorService))
                .whenComplete((result, ex) -> executorService.shutdown());

If you want the results of these individual CompletableFutures, then we can simply use the "thenAccept" -

    CompletableFuture<String> fetchDataFuture = fetchData(executorService);
    CompletableFuture<String> processDataFuture = processData(executorService);
    CompletableFuture<String> generateReportFuture = generateReport(executorService);

    CompletableFuture
            .allOf(fetchDataFuture, processDataFuture, generateReportFuture)
            .whenComplete((result, ex) -> executorService.shutdown());

    fetchDataFuture.thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Data fetched: "+ result));
    processDataFuture.thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Data processed: "+ result));
    generateReportFuture.thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Report Generated: "+ result));

There is another method for handling multiple completable futures named "anyOf". This one also takes a comma seaprated list of futures but this one does not wait for all to complete. If any one completes, then its job is done.

"CompletableFuture.anyOf" is a method in "CompletableFuture" that allows you to wait for the first of multiple asynchronous tasks to complete, rather than waiting for all of them. Itâ€™s particularly useful when you have multiple tasks but want to proceed as soon as one of them finishes (for example, when you have multiple sources of data and want to use the result of whichever finishes first).

Unlike "allOf" which returns a "void" type of "CompletableFuture", the "anyOf" returns CompletableFuture<Object>. The result of this newly returned "CompletableFuture" is the result of whichever future completed first.Since it returns CompletableFuture<Object>, you might need to cast the result to the specific type you expect.

So, if we have three tasks that fetch data from 3 different sources and we want to just get data from the source that gives it first, we can use "anyOf" -

    CompletableFuture
        .anyOf(fetchDataFromSourceA(executorService), fetchDataFromSourceB(executorService), fetchDataFromSourceC(executorService))
        .thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Result of first completed Future: "+ result))
        .whenComplete((result, ex) -> executorService.shutdown());

# WAITING AND BLOCKING

If we want to block the main thread and wait for the "CompletableFuture" to complete, then we can simply use "get()" method, just how we were doing it with a normal "Future".

    String result = future.get();

We know that when we use "get" we have to handle the potential exception that it may throw. 

There is another method named "join()" which we can use which does not throw any checked exceptionsa and we can use it instead of "get()" as well.

    String result = future.join();

# TIMEOUTS

There are some methods that we can use for causing the "CompletableFuture" to throw an exception if it does not complete within specified time.

One method is named "orTimeout" that takes the timeout value -

    future.orTimeout(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

If the "CompletableFuture" does not complete in the specified time, it will throw a "TimeoutException".

What if we want to return some "default" value if the "CompletableFuture" does not complete in specified time? In that case, we can use "completeOnTimeout" which takes an argument which is the default value - 

    future.completeOnTimeout("Default Value", 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

# EXCEPTION HANDLING

Finally, let's take a look at some methods that we can use to handle exceptions.

First is "exceptionally" which lets us define some alternate action if a "CompletableFuture" completes with an exception.

    future.exceptionally(ex -> {
        System.out.println("Error: " + ex.getMessage());
        return "Default Value";
    });

Second is "handle" which processes the result of "CompletableFuture" and it handles both the "success" and "exception" cases - 

    future.handle((result, ex) -> {
        if (ex != null) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + ex.getMessage());
            return "Fallback";
        }
        return result + " Success";
    });

Finally, we have "whenComplete" which allows performing an action on completion of "CompletableFuture", regardless of "success" or "exception" - 

    future.whenComplete((result, ex) -> {
        if (ex != null) System.out.println("Error: " + ex.getMessage());
        else System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    });

"whenComplete" will not alter the result of the "CompletableFuture". It just lets you observe and handle the outcome without changing the outcome itself. It does not return a new result; instead, it returns a "CompletableFuture<Void>" that completes after the callback finishes.

"handle" is more versatile because it lets you handle both success and failure and allows you to return a new result. Unlike "whenComplete", "handle" allows you to change or replace the result of the "CompletableFuture", regardless of whether it succeeded or failed.
 
When to use which?

    - Use whenComplete when you want to perform an action after the completion of a "CompletableFuture", like logging, but donâ€™t need to change its result.
  
    - Use handle when you want to handle both success and failure cases, and potentially transform the result or provide a fallback value in case of an error.
