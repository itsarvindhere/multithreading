We saw that if we want to "Reuse" a "CountDownLatch", we simply cannot. We have to create a whole new "CountDownLatch" instead.

We can allow a set of threads to wait for each other to reach a common barrier point using "CyclicBarrier".

It is useful in scenarios where you need multiple threads to meet at a certain point before continuing their execution. This is especially useful for tasks that can be split into parallel subtasks, which need to synchronize at particular steps, like matrix multiplication, data processing, or game simulations.

"CyclicBarrier" is "reusable", meaning once the barrier is broken (all threads have arrived), it can be reset and used again.

The number of threads that must call "await()" before they can proceed are called "parties". The "CyclicBarrier" is initialized with the number of "parties".

So, if we write -

    CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3);

It means, "3" threads must call "await()" on this "barrier". We can also pass a second argument to this constructor which is a lambda function that runs when all threads have arrived at the barrier - 

    CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3, () -> System.out.println("All parties have reached the barrier! Proceeding..."));

# ANALOGY

Imagine you’re organizing a group tour for three friends. You decide to visit three landmarks, but you all agree that you’ll only move to the next landmark when everyone has arrived at the current one. Here’s how it works:

    Landmark 1 (First Barrier Point): Each friend arrives at the landmark at different times, depending on their pace. When they arrive, they must wait for the others to reach this spot too. Once everyone is there, you all agree to move to the next landmark together.

    Landmark 2 (Second Barrier Point): The same thing happens—each person might get there at a different time, but they wait at the landmark until everyone has arrived. Only then do you continue to the final destination.

    Landmark 3 (Final Barrier Point): After everyone reaches the last landmark, the tour is complete.

In this analogy:

    - Each landmark acts as a barrier where everyone has to gather.
    - The group decision to move together to the next location represents the "CyclicBarrier" action that happens after all threads (friends) reach a common point.
    - If any one friend can’t make it to the landmark, the group remains stuck at the barrier (or the process gets interrupted).

Just as you would wait for everyone in the group before moving forward, "CyclicBarrier" ensures that all threads reach a certain point before they’re allowed to proceed. The “cyclic” part is like having multiple stops in a tour, where this waiting behavior repeats at each landmark.

# CODE

There is no "countDown" method on "CyclicBarrier" like we had for "CountDownLatch". Instead, for each task that we pass to a thread, we can call "await()" inside "run()" like this - 

    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " service started!");
            Thread.sleep(1000); <- SIMULATING SOME WORK
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is waiting a the barrier!");
            barrier.await(); <- WAIT AT THE BARRIER
        } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

So, our main method will look like this - 

        public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException, BrokenBarrierException {

            int numberOfServices = 3;
            CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(numberOfServices, () -> System.out.println("All parties have reached the barrier! Proceeding..."));

            for(int i = 0; i < numberOfServices; i++) {
                new Thread(new DependentService1(barrier)).start();
            }

            System.out.println("All dependent services finished. Starting main method...");
        }

And now, the terminal will print - 

    All dependent services finished. Starting main method...
    Thread-1 service started!
    Thread-2 service started!
    Thread-0 service started!
    Thread-1 is waiting a the barrier!
    Thread-0 is waiting a the barrier!
    Thread-2 is waiting a the barrier!
    All parties have reached the barrier! Proceeding...

It is important to note that "CyclicBarrier" will not block the main thread, something the "CountDownLatch" was doing. That's why we see that the line "All dependent services finished. Starting main method..." got printed even before all threads executed.

# HOW TO MAKE THE MAIN THREAD WAIT?

We can use "ExecutorService" if we want to make the main thread wait so we can then "submit" the tasks to this "ExecutorService" instead of us creating new threads manually using "new Thread".

    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException, BrokenBarrierException {

        int numberOfServices = 3;
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfServices);
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(numberOfServices, () -> System.out.println("All parties have reached the barrier! Proceeding..."));

        for(int i = 0; i < numberOfServices; i++) {
            executorService.submit(new DependentService1(barrier));
        }
        executorService.shutdown(); <- NO MORE TASKS CAN BE SUBMITTED

        executorService.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES); <- WAITS FOR ALL TASKS TO FINISH OR THE 1 MINUTE TIMEOUT TO OCCUR

        System.out.println("All dependent services finished. Starting main method...");
    }

So, in this case, the terminal will print -

    pool-1-thread-3 service started!
    pool-1-thread-2 service started!
    pool-1-thread-1 service started!
    pool-1-thread-3 is waiting a the barrier!
    pool-1-thread-2 is waiting a the barrier!
    pool-1-thread-1 is waiting a the barrier!
    All parties have reached the barrier! Proceeding...
    All dependent services finished. Starting main method...

# CYCLICBARRIER IS REUSABLE

"CyclicBarrier" is reusable because, once all threads reach the barrier point and the barrier is "broken," it automatically resets, allowing it to be used again in the next cycle. This makes "CyclicBarrier" particularly useful in scenarios where threads need to repeatedly synchronize at certain points during execution, like in iterative algorithms, simulations, or phased computations.

After all threads cross the barrier, it automatically resets for the next cycle.

# ANOTHER EXAMPLE

Let's take another example to see how "CyclicBarrier" can be helpful.

Suppose we have a "system" and there are various services like "Web Server", "Database", "Cachhe", "Messaging Service". We need to ensure that all of them have been initialized successfully before we start doing anything.

In this case, we can use "CyclicBarrier". We can specify that we have "4" parties and all of them must reach a barrier.

Suppose, this is our class that implements "Runnable" - 

    class Subsystem implements Runnable {

        private String name;

        private int initializationTime;

        private CyclicBarrier barrier;

        public Subsystem(String name, int initializationTime, CyclicBarrier barrier) {
            this.name = name;
            this.initializationTime = initializationTime;
            this.barrier = barrier;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                System.out.println(name + " initialization started.");
                Thread.sleep(initializationTime);
                System.out.println(name + " initialization complete.");
                barrier.await();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            } catch (BrokenBarrierException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }
    }

So here, in the "run" method, we simply make the current Thread wait for the "initializationTime" milliseconds. And we also call "await()".

This is the main method - 


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numberOfSubSystems = 4;

        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(numberOfSubSystems, () -> System.out.println("All subsystems are up and running. System startup complete."));

        Thread webServerThread = new Thread(new Subsystem("Web Server", 2000, barrier));
        Thread databaseThread = new Thread(new Subsystem("Database", 4000, barrier));
        Thread cacheThread = new Thread(new Subsystem("Cache", 3000, barrier));
        Thread messagingServiceThread = new Thread(new Subsystem("Messaging Service", 3500, barrier));

        webServerThread.start();
        databaseThread.start();
        cacheThread.start();
        messagingServiceThread.start();
    }


So now, you can see here, we have four threads where each thread will be used to initialize a separate service (in theory).

In this case, the terminal will print - 

    Messaging Service initialization started.
    Cache initialization started.
    Web Server initialization started.
    Database initialization started.
    Web Server initialization complete.
    Cache initialization complete.
    Messaging Service initialization complete.
    Database initialization complete.
    All subsystems are up and running. System startup complete.

Maybe we want to do something when all the subsystems are up and running. In that case, instead of simply printing something by passing a second argument to "CyclicBarrier" constructor, we can pass some Runnable that has the logic we want to run after all the services are up and running. That's the benefit of a "CyclicBarrier".
