In a multithreaded environment, the threads often need to communicate and coordinate with each other to accomplish some task.

Without a proper communication mechanisms, the threads might end up in inefficient busy-waiting states, leading to wastage of CPU resources and potential deadlocks.

Let's take an example of a "Producer" thread and a "Consumer" thread.

A producer thread might produce data that a consumer thread needs to process. Without proper communication, the consumer might try to consume data before it is available.

The producer thread needs to inform the consumer thread when new data is available, and the consumer thread needs to signal when the buffer is ready for more data.

If this does not happen, the consumer will keep on checking if the producer has some data or not which is going to waste CPU resources.

Another reason to have a proper Thread Communication is to avoid "Race Conditions". Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to read and write shared data concurrently without synchronization. Without communication mechanisms, threads might overwrite each other's results or read inconsistent data.

Example: In banking systems, if multiple threads are handling balance updates, proper thread communication ensures that the balance is updated in a consistent and synchronized manner.

Some threads depend on the results or completion of other threads. Communication helps one thread to notify another when its work is done, ensuring the dependent thread can proceed at the right time.

Example: A background task might need to notify the main thread when its data processing is complete, allowing the main thread to update the user interface.

# wait(), notify(), and notifyAll()

There are methods in the "Object" class that are used for communication between the threads and these are - 

    - wait()
    - notify()
    - notifyAll()
  
These methods can only be called within a "synchronized" context. This means, only inside a "synchronized" method or a "synchronized" block you can call these three methods.

If called outside of a "synchronized" block or method, the JVM will throw an 'IllegalMonitorStateException'.

They are used in scenarios where one or more threads need to wait for a condition to be met, while another thread fulfills that condition and notifies the waiting threads.

A thread goes into the waiting state when wait() is called. It remains in this state until notified or interrupted.

Once a thread is notified, it transitions back to the runnable state. However, it cannot proceed until it regains the lock for the object.

## wait() METHOD

The "wait()" method causes the current thread to release the lock it holds and enter the waiting state until another thread calls "notify()" or "notifyAll()" on the same object.

Once the thread is notified (or interrupted), it does not resume execution immediately but must wait until it can reacquire the lock for the object.

When a thread calls wait(), it releases the lock it holds and enters the waiting state. Another thread must signal it with notify() or notifyAll() after some condition is met.

## notify() METHOD

The "notify()" method wakes up one of the threads that is waiting on the object's monitor (lock). If multiple threads are waiting, it is up to the JVM to decide which one gets notified.

The notified thread remains in the waiting state until it can reacquire the lock on the object.

## notifyAll() method

The "notifyAll()" method wakes up all the threads that are waiting on the object's monitor. All the waiting threads will move from the waiting state to a runnable state, but they still need to reacquire the lock one at a time.

This is generally used when multiple threads are waiting for a condition to be fulfilled, and notifying all of them is safe.

# EXAMPLE

Let's take the same producer-consumer problem.

Let's say we have a class named "SharedResource" that has a "data" and a boolean flag named "hasData" that indicates if there is data for the consumer to consume. And we have two methods "produce" and "consume". One will produce some data and the other consumes it.

    class SharedResource {

        private int data;

        private boolean hasData;

        public void produce(int value){
        }

        public int consume(){
        }
    }

Now, we only want to "produce" data if there is no data left to consume. That is, if "hasData" is false. This means, if hasData is true, we want to wait till it becomes false.

    public synchronized void produce(int value){
        while(hasData){
            try {
                wait(); // wait if the data is already produced
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }

        data = value;
        hasData = true;
        System.out.println("Produced: "+ data);
        notify(); // notify the consumer
    }

So here, if there is data, then "hasData" will be true. So, we want the Thread to release any lock it has on this SharedResource instance and wait till some other thread calls "notify" or "notifyAll".

But, if there is no data, then set the "data" field to the passed value and then set the "hasData" flag to "true". Finally, also make sure to call "notify()" so that if there are threads that are waiting to consume data but cannot do it because "hasData" was false so far, then they start consuming it now.

Similarly, we only want to "consume" data if there is data to consume. That is, if the "hasData" is true. Otherwise, we want to wait till "hasData" becomes true.

    public synchronized int consume(){
        while(!hasData) {
            try {
                wait(); // wait until resource is produced
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
        hasData = false;
        System.out.println("Consumed: "+ data);
        notify(); // notify the producer
        return data;
    }

Here also, the same story. The only difference is, in this case, we will wait if there is no data. And only if data is available, we wil return it and notify() the ProducerThread that we are done consuming and hence "hasData" is set to "false" again.

Note that both these are "synchronized" methods because as we know, "wait()" and "notify()" can only be used in "synchronized" context.

And now, the rest of the code is pretty simple. We can create two "Runnable" classes, one for "produce" and one for "consume".

    class Producer implements Runnable {
        private final SharedResource resource;

        public Producer(SharedResource resource){
            this.resource = resource;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                resource.produce(i);
            }
        }
    }

    class Consumer implements Runnable {
        private final SharedResource resource;

        public Consumer(SharedResource resource){
            this.resource = resource;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                resource.consume();
            }
        }
    }

And this is our main method - 

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        Thread producerThread = new Thread(new Producer(resource));
        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(new Consumer(resource));

        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
    }

And the output will be - 

    Produced: 0
    Consumed: 0
    Produced: 1
    Consumed: 1
    Produced: 2
    Consumed: 2
    Produced: 3
    Consumed: 3
    Produced: 4
    Consumed: 4
    Produced: 5
    Consumed: 5
    Produced: 6
    Consumed: 6
    Produced: 7
    Consumed: 7
    Produced: 8
    Consumed: 8
    Produced: 9
    Consumed: 9

So, the summary is - 

    - wait(): Puts the calling thread into a waiting state, releasing the lock.

    - notify(): Wakes up one waiting thread, which must reacquire the lock before proceeding.

    - nnotifyAll(): Wakes up all waiting threads, but only one can proceed at a time, depending on lock availability.

These methods are crucial for ensuring proper coordination in multithreaded Java applications.

If we had multiple consumers, then we could use notifyAll() so as to wake up all those waiting consumer threads.

What would happen if we hadn't used wait() or notify()?

Without "wait()", if the producer tries to produce when the resource is already available (or the consumer tries to consume when it's not available), both threads will keep looping endlessly, checking the available condition. This results in busy waiting.

The threads will constantly check the condition without releasing the CPU, leading to inefficient resource usage and potential performance degradation.

In the absence of "wait()" and "notify()", there is no proper synchronization between the producer and consumer threads. Both may try to access or modify the shared available variable at the same time.

For instance, the producer might produce a resource while the consumer is also trying to consume it, leading to a race condition. This can cause unpredictable and inconsistent results.

Without "notify()", even if one thread completes its work (i.e., the producer has produced a resource), the other thread (the consumer) will not be notified to proceed. This could lead to thread starvation, where one thread is stuck indefinitely waiting for an event that never happens.

There is also a potential for deadlock if both threads end up waiting for a resource or condition that never changes, leading to a halt in program execution.
