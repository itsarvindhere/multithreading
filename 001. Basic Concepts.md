# CPU

It is often referred to as the brain of the computer and it is responsive for the execution of instructions from programs. It performs basic arithmetic, logic, control and I/O operations specified by the instructions.

# CORE

A core is an individual processing unit within a CPU. Modern CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

For example, when we say a "Quad-core" processor, it means that the CPU has four cores, allowing it to perform four tasks simultaneously. For instance, one core could handle your web browser, another your music player, another a download manager, and another a background system update.

# PROGRAM

A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells the computer how to perform a specific task. 

For example, Microsoft Word is a program that allows users to create and edit documents.

# PROCESS

A process is an instance of a program that is being executed. When a program runs, the OS creates a process to manage its execution. 

For example, when we open Microsoft Word, it becomes a process in the OS.

# THREAD

A Thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads, which share the same resources but they can run independently.

For example, a web browser like Google Chrome might use multiple threads for different tabs, with each tab running as a separate thread.

# MULTITASKING

It is the ability of an operating system to run multiple processes simultaneously. On single-core CPUs, this is done through time-sharing, rapidly switching between tasks. On multi-core CPUs, true parallel execution occurs, with tasks distributed across cores. The OS scheduler balances the load, ensuring an efficient and responsive system performance.

For example, we can browse the internet while listening to music and downloading a file.

Multitasking utilizes the capabilities of a CPU and its cores. When an OS performs multitasking, it can assign different tasks to different cores. This is more efficient than assigning all the tasks to a single core.

# MULTITHREADING

Multithreading refers to the ability to execute multiple threads within a single process concurrently.

For example, a web browser can use multithreading by having separate threads for rendering the page, running JavaScript, and managing the user inputs. This makes the browser more responsive and efficient.

Multithreading enhances the efficiency of multitasking by breaking down the individual tasks into smaller sub-tasks or threads. These threads can be processed simultaneously, making better use of the CPU's capabilities.

In a single-core system, both the threads and processes are managed by the OS scheduler through time slicing and context switching to create the illusion of simultanous execution.

In a multi-core system, both the threads and processes can run in true parallel on different cores, with the OS scheduler distributing tasks across the cores to optimize the performance.

Multitasking can be achieved through Multithreading where each task is divided into threads that are managed concurrently. While Multitasking typically refers to the running of multiple applications, Multithreading is more granular, dealing with multiple threads within the same application or process.

Multitasking operates at the level of processes, which are the OS's primary units of execution.

Multithreading operates on the level of threads, which are the smaller units within a process.

Multitasking involves managing resources between completely separate programs, which may have independent memory spaces and system resources.

Multithreading involves managing resources within a single program, where the threads share the same memory and resources.

Multitasking allows us to run multiple applications simultaneously, improving productivity and system utilization. 

Multithreading allows a single application to perform multiple tasks at the same time, improving application performance and responsiveness.

## TIME SLICING

Time Slicing divides the CPU time into small intervals called time slices or "quanta". The OS scheduler allocates these time slices to different processes and threads, ensuring that each gets a fair share of the CPU time.

This prevents any single process or threads from monopolizing the CPU, improving the responsiveness and enabling concurrent execution.

## CONTEXT SWITCHING

Context Switching is the process of saving the state of a currently running process or thread and loading the state of the next one to be executed.

When a process or thread's time slice expires, the OS scheduler performs a context switch to move the CPU's focus to the other process or thread.

This allows multiple processes and threads to share the CPU, giving the appearance of simultanous execution on a single-core CPU or improving parallelism on multi-core CPUs.
