So far, we have seen some Thread class methods already such as "run", "start", "sleep", "join" etc.

The "run" method is the one that we override in the class that extends the "Thread" class or implements the "Runnable" interface. This is the method inside which we write the logic that we want to run in a separate thread.

The "start" method causes the particular Thread to start execution. Internally, JVM will call the "run" method of this thread.

The "sleep" method causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease execution) for the specified number of milliseconds, subject to the precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers.

The "join" method waits for the thread (on which it is called) to die/finish executing.

What all other methods are provided by this class? Let's learn about some of them.

# setPrority(int newPriority)

As the name suggests, this method lets us set the priorities for different threads in our application.

Before that, let's see what is the default priority if we create a new Thread.


    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        System.out.println(t1.getName() + " - " + t1.getPriority());
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + Thread.currentThread().getPriority());
    }

Now, if you see the terminal, you will see that it logs - 

    Thread-0 - 5
    main - 5

It means, by default, both the "main" thread and the "Thread-0" have the same priority of "5".

So, to give a specific prioritty to a Thread, we can use a method named "setPriority" on that Thread object. If you are wondering what is the minimum and maximum value, then the minimum value is "1" and the maximum value is "10".

This means, if you try to write - 

    t1.setPriority(20);

This will not show any errors in IDE but when you run the code, it will throw the "IllegalArgumentException".

The reason is that the "setPriority" method is defined like this - 

    public final void setPriority(int newPriority) {
        checkAccess();
        if (newPriority > MAX_PRIORITY || newPriority < MIN_PRIORITY) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }
        if (!isVirtual()) {
            priority(newPriority);
        }
    }

So, if the new priority value is greater than the Maximum Priority value of 10 or it is smaller than the minimum priority value of 1, then this will throw an "IllegalArgumentException".

As an absolute value, a priority is meaningless; a higher-priority thread doesn't run any faster than a lower-priority thread if it is the only thread running. Instead, a thread's priority is used to decide when to switch from one running thread to the next.

So, in our code, we can do something like - 

        MyThread l = new MyThread();
        l.setName("LOW PRIORITY THREAD");
        l.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY); // 1

        MyThread m = new MyThread();
        m.setName("MEDIUM PRIORITY THREAD");
        m.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY); // 5

        MyThread h = new MyThread();
        h.setName("HIGH PRIORITY THREAD");
        h.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // 10

# interrupt()

This method will interrupt the thread on which it is called.

An interrupt is an indication to a thread that it should stop what it is doing and do something else. It's up to the programmer to decide exactly how a thread responds to an interrupt, but it is very common for the thread to terminate.

For example, if we have a run method like this - 

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread Interrupted: "+ e);
        }
        
        System.out.println("I am running!");

    }

And we have a main method with this - 

    MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
    myThread.start();
    myThread.interrupt();

Then, the terminal will print - 
    
    Thread Interrupted: java.lang.InterruptedException: sleep interrupted
    I am running!

    

So, as soon as we called interrupt() method, even though the Thread was sleeping for 5 seconds, its sleep was interrupted. And while the run() method was supposed to print the text after waiting for 5 second, it did not do that because we interrupted its sleep so it stopped sleeping. So, the text is printed instantly after the Interrupted Exception is thrown and caught in the "catch" block.

# yield()

This is used to give a hint to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of a processor. It is up to the schedular to do something. The scheduler is free to ignore this hint.

This method will stop the currently executing thread and will give a chance to other waiting threads of the same priority

It is rarely appropriate to use this method. It may be useful for debugging or testing purposes, where it may help to reproduce bugs due to race conditions.

Let's say we have this run method - 

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running!");
        }
    }

And we create two threads - 

    MyThread myThread1 = new MyThread();
    MyThread myThread2 = new MyThread();

    myThread1.start();
    myThread2.start();

If you run this code, you will see that the output is not always the same. Sometimes you might see one thread's name printed 5 times in the row, somethimes you might see only 4 instances printed and then the 5th one at the end. 

But, what if we want to do something like this - print a value in first thread, then print a value in second thread and then first and then second and then so on.

So, we want this alternate printing of values. And here, we can use "yield".

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running!");
            Thread.yield();
        }
    }

As we print a value in a thread, we will call "yield" which means this thread is willing to yield its current use of the processor so that the other thread can run now.

Now, as we mentioned above, it all depends on the scheduler how to print values, even though we gave it a hint that the Thread wants to yield its current use of the processor. So, as you run the code again and again, you will still get different order of printed values.

# setDaemon(boolean on)

This method is used to mark a thread as a "Daemon" thread.

What is a Daemon thread?

For that, we need to understand that whatever Threads we have been creating so far, they are "User Threads". A user thread is a thread that is created by the application (user), and, in most cases, a daemon thread is created by the JVM to serve the user threads.

The difference between these two types of threads is straightforward: If the Java runtime determines that the only threads running in an application are daemon threads (i.e., there are no user threads in existence) the Java runtime promptly closes down the application, effectively stopping all daemon threads dead in their tracks.

In order for an application to continue running, it must always have at least one live user thread. In all other respects the Java runtime treats daemon threads and user threads in exactly the same manner.

Here is a really good example to see this in action. 

Let's say we have a thread with run method like this - 

    @Override
    public void run() {
        while(true) System.out.println("Hello World");
    }

So, this will be an infinite loop because the condition is always True.

Now, if we create a new thread object and call "start" on it -

    MyThread myThread1 = new MyThread();
    myThread1.start();

What will happen? Ofcourse there will be an infinite loop.

So, JVM did not stop this execution because it is a User Thread. And as we understood, as long as there is at least one user thread, then the application will continue running. Now, what if it was a Daemon thread?

So, to make it a Daemon thread, we can use the "setDaemon" method - 

    MyThread myThread1 = new MyThread();
    myThread1.setDaemon(true);
    myThread1.start();

Now, you will see that the "Hello World" is printed just once or not even printed or maybe printed just a few times.

It is important to note that the "main" Thread is also a User Thread. And since we have written the above code in a main method, it means it is the Main Thread that runs the above lines of code. And that's why, as soon as it executes the "start()" method, "Hello World" gets printed (zero or a few times) but after that, the "main" thread gets terminated because everything in the "main" method has been executed.

Now, even though we have a new Thread named "myThread1", it is not a User Thread so now, the application has 0 User Threads which means JVM will now stop the execution of the application.

When this thread was not a Daemon Thread, the JVM did not stop the execution as this thread was a User Thread at that time.

One good example of a Daemon Thread is the Garbage Collection in Java. Garbage Collection keeps happening in the background but as soon as there are 0 User Threads, JVM will stop the execution of the application, even if the Garbage Collector is doing something at that time.
